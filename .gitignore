### ======= Visual Studio Code ======= ###

##
## Created by following and/or considering:
## https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
## We are not "un-ignoring" any files, but ignoring the whole folder - we do not want any settings
## etc. of VSCode in the repository.
##
## Normally, this should be part of the global .gitignore file of anyone using VSCode. However, on
## the VR-Lab computer, this is already not true, and we cannot change it. Thus, it is included in
## here.
