# Virtual Self

This repository contains the result of a 4-person project over 1 year whose goal was to create a Virtual Reality demo that combines full body tracking (using VRPN) with hand gesture detection (using LeapMotion).

This project is only for archival purposes. As this was a research project, running it requires quite an elaborate setup and wasn't tested outside our lab. The setup included:
- Two computers, with one running the application and one running the VRPN server
- A 6x6mÂ² area with two HTC Vive Lighthouses for head tracking
- A full-body wearable kit and four cameras mounted at the front of the area for optical tracking
- A LeapMotion sensor mounted on the Vive headset
