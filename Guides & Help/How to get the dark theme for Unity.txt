I can confirm that this works.
Also, HxD is a good Hex editor (even if old), completely free, and automatically creates a backup of the file you're editing when you
save it, too.


Instructions:

1. Download a hex editor such as HxD and make sure you have Unity installed and that Unity isn't running.

2. Move "Unity.exe" from "C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor" onto your desktop.

3. Open up Unity.exe with your hex editor and search for "84 C0 75 08 33 C0 48 83 C4 20 5B C3 8B 03 48 83 C4 20 5B C3" (with hex value ticked).

4. Change the third position 75 to 74 and save.

5. Move the Unity.exe back into "C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor" to override the existing one.

6. Run Unity and you should now have the dark theme!
