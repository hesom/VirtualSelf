In general, Git should handle everything automatically once Git LFS has been set up. The repository
is already configured to use it, and the LFS-tracked files should be pulled and pushed correctly
by default.



For the Command Line:

Just go here: https://git-lfs.github.com/
Follow step 1. That's all you have to do.


For SourceTree:

When cloning a repository for the first time that uses Git LFS, SourceTree should ask you about
whether it should set up Git LFS. Just accept, and it should work afterwards.
