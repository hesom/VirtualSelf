Renaming the template project to how you want it to be named is simple:

1. Clone (download) a fresh copy of the repository. This is so that there are none of Unity's
   auto-generated files, as some of these are dependent on the project name/path.
2. Rename the Unity project folder ("Template Project") to the name you want

That's it.

Notice:
This does NOT change the name of the game. This is changed inside of the Unity, under:
"Edit > Project Settings > Player > Product Name".

Notice:
This does NOT change the name of the game's executable file (when it's been built). This is changed
inside of Unity, under: "File > Build Settings".
