The SmartMerge tool is part of Unity by default. It does not have to be installed separately.
However, Git has to be told where the tool is, and that it should use it when appropriate.
(When exactly it is appropriate, is set up in the .gitattributes file.)



For the Command Line:

Add the following snippet to the end of ".git/config". Replace the dual brackets (( )) with the
path to your Unity installation root folder. Unity will then find and use the tool for the files
where it is told to use it.

[merge]
tool = unityyamlmerge

[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
trustExitCode = false
keepTemporaries = true
keepBackup = false
path = ((Path to Unity Installation Root))/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe
cmd = \"((Path to Unity Installation Root))/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe\" merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"


For SourceTree:

1. Open SourceTree, go to "Tools > Options > Diff".
2. Select "Custom" in the "Merge Tool" dropdown.
3. Type the path to "UnityYAMLMerge.exe" [see the snippet above!] in the "Merge Command" text field.
4. Type "merge -p $BASE $REMOTE $LOCAL $MERGED" in the "Arguments" text field.

(Leave the rest just like it is.)
