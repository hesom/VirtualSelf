  description: 'Welcome to the Main Hub.

    This is the central room, and you can always return here. On the wall, you will
    find a panel that will keep you updated about all the keycodes you discover during
    this training run, and the rooms associated with them. So don''t worry about forgetting
    anything!


    Check the panel now. The keycode for the next room is already on it.'
